## Experst lecture By Dr. Priya Darshni Madam on "Univeral Human Values".
the slides shown by mam focuses on fufilling the basic human aspirations of happiness and prosperity in continuity through right understanding , harmonious relationships , and right utilisations of physical facilities . Happiness is defined as being in a state of harmony , while unhappiness arises from disharmony or contracdication. The material also diffrentiates between temporary excitements - obtained from external sources such as  possessions , sensations and approval from othrs - and genuine happiness , which is stable and self - renewed . Prosperity is to produce more than required without hoarding or exploitation and it is distinct from accumulation of riches . The method of self - discovery - testing ideas via natural acceptance and experimental confrimation - results in manual bliss and manual prosperity . The assignments promote  self - reflection on the everyday activites , considering whether the resulting happiness is permanent or fleeting and measuring time invested in right understanding , relationships and physical facilities to ensure conformity with long - term well - being and harmonious living at all levels - individual, family , society , and nature..

Each discipline puts various aspects of speed ,control, endurance, and driving ability to the test , often in challenging condiiton.

Engineering is a key component in motor sports , since performance , safety, and dependability rely significantly on state -of-the -art technological design .Automotive engineers addresss topics like aerodynamics (to minimize drag and maximize downforce) , powertrain engineering (engines ,transmission , and fuel systems ), suspension and chassis tuning (for stabilityand handling ), and material science (to recocile strenght with lightweight construction ). Computer modeling , wind tunnel testing , and data analutics are key technologies that emerge there eventually make their way into consumer vehicles , such as disc brakes advanced tires , turbocharging  ,hybrid systems, and safety features . So in addition to human and mechanical limits , which are pushed forward the development of atuomotive engeering and sustainable mobility.
